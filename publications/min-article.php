                I am surrounded by Nihilists, Reactionaries, and People Who's Thinking Is Too Uptight, but I will Abide. Though it seems there are more Gutters than Strikes, and more Downs than Ups, I will Abide. As I face my enemies, their aggression will not stand, and I will draw a line across which they shall not cross, for my mind is Limber and I Just Take It Easy. I Abide.
